# Welcome!

Sailfish is a .NET library that you can use to write performance tests that are**:

- simple, consistent & familiar
- run in process (for easy debugging and development)
- sychronous or asynchronous
- flexible
- compatible with standard dependency injection

This libary was built to support and inspire the incorporation of performance testing into test driven development as well as the creation of production ready performance monitoring systems.
