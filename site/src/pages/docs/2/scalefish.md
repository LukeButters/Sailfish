**Scalefish** is a machine learning tool used to perform regression analysis.

When enabled, scalefish will discover test cases with scalefish-enabled variables and use them to fit result data against various parameterized functions representing general complexity curves.

This outputs a model file and a results file once your run is complete. The model file can be used to make predictions.


⚠️ Customizing output of scalefish result files is comming soon...
