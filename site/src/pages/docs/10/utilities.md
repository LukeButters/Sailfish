# Utilities

Sailfish exposes a range of utlities classes that will help you pre and post process your data, as well as read in a write out data. Sailfish also exploses various statistical tools for your convenience.

### Reading Structured file outputs

Sailfish writes files in CSV (writing to JSON is on the roadmap to be supported) format and therefore exposes CSV parsing contracts (used with CSV Helper).
