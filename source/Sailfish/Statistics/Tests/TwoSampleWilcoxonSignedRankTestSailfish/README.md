# Two Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test

* Note - this test is NOT the same as the ManWhitneyWilcoxonTest.

## Usage

Use this test when you have non-normal distributions and need to test if your current population fits the other distribution.

This test assumes equal sample sizes. An exception will be thrown if samples sizes differ.
