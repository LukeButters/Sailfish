# Veer Performa Test Runner Scenario

This project demonstrates how how the VeerPerforma.TestAdapter allows you to execute test classes directly from a class library project that has the test adapter installed.

Since Veer Performa only supports a single execution method per class, you'll only see the small play button in your IDE appear next to the class name.

Hitting the play button will call the Veer Performa execution logic, pass the class to the executor, create a parameter grid based on any variables you have defined, and then invoke the execution method for each variable combination.
